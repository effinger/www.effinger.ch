We hereby invite you to the third incarnation of the Demonights. As it is short notice, summertime's running short and the days are busy,  we plan to just gather up, snack and drink, hang on a sofa or a comfy chair, and watch demos. Adventurous participants may dive deeper and work on a production, discuss demo effects, or share some tips on making a 1k, 4k, 64k,... prod.

This is a meetup and electronic arts performance organized by Echtzeit - Digitale Kultur, the Swiss association in support of the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene). Memories of our previous events in the Labor (E-0010) space are [here](http://showmethedemo.buenz.li/) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/demodays).
