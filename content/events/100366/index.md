<div class="lead">
Already wondered how data from sensors and other low energy devices can be easily put to use? Our upcoming meetup is about The Things Network and OpenThings, which are initiatives to provide a simple and low cost way to publish IoT data to the public, friends, customers.
</div>

There are over [100 gateways in Bern](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community/Bern/), and we have recently installed an indoor gateway at Effinger to start some "smart building" projects to benefit the coworking community. Your DIY ideas and helping hands are wanted! This workshop is taking place on **Tuesday, November 19**, downstairs in the Effinger [Raum Matte](https://www.effinger.ch/raeume/matte/). Please [register at Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/The-Things-Network-Bern/events/265540114/) or send us a note through the [open data forum](https://forum.opendata.ch/t/12-11-ttn-effinger/596/1) or some [other channel](https://twitter.com/sodacamper/status/1189127910084501504) if you're coming, just so we can keep track of numbers.

<div style="background:yellow">
<b>Please Note:</b> we will be having a small meetup in the back of the Effinger Lounge one week earlier, on <u>Tuesday November 12</u>, to test the gateway and do some set up for the workshop. You do not need to sign up, just come out and look for people with open circuits.

This is one of the first meetups organized by local members of the non-profit [Open Network Infrastructure Association](https://opennetworkinfrastructure.org/), which is committed to democratizing access and spreading knowledge about the Internet of Things. Many of our members are familiar with building low cost devices, use platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, make prototypes at [hackathons](https://now.makezurich.ch/) and [FabLabs](https://fablab-bern.ch/), connect their applications and share their data on open platforms.

Within this hands-on event we will give you a tour of the brand new OpenThings! platform, which allows you to instantly visualize your IoT projects. It is based on thingsboard community edition, a very powerful data acquisition, storage and dashboard solution. Feel free to check the potential at https://thingsboard.io

Please bring your laptop and, if you have one, a [TTN-capable device](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/) with you. Of course, if you don't have access to a running device, we will provide you a data stream from one of ours... and yes, we speak German, French and English!
