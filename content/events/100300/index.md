It's 2019 and we keep on going with the Demonights series. The next date that you better do not miss if you're anywhere close enough is the 9th of March 2019 when Demonights 008 take place. This time we bring you a truly oldschool story, told by two scene legends from Berne.

In this edition of the DEMONIGHTS we proudly introduce you to `Amicom` and `Depeche` - and here's what we will hear from them:

**YOᑌᖇ ᔕYᔕTEᗰ Iᔕ IᑎᖴEᑕTEᗪ**

In the late 80s, the Amiga demoscene flourished. Even here in Bern and its suburbs talented boys (and unfortunately no girls) were coding, c̾r̾a̾c̾k̾i̾n̾g̾, reserve engineering as if there was no tomorrow.

This was the time of our youth and 30 years later we have a confession to make. We have created the first file based virus on the Amiga. For the first time ever we will unveil the complete story of this virus.

Alongside with this yet untold adventurous story, we'll entertain you with the latest demoware from back then, from today and from in between. Come join us on this journey to a thing that started more than 30 years ago.
