# à la carte (open discussion format)

At Café Philo(u) à la carte, everyone present has the opportunity to suggest a topic for philosophical discussion. The hosts Andreas Heise and Lan Tran collect the suggestions and put them to the vote in a suitable form. The topic proposal with the most votes wins the debate and is introduced by its proponent. This is followed by an open discussion round: everyone present has the right to speak. Priority will be given to those who have not yet had their say.

Back-up solution: If no topics are suggested, or no topic gains favour, we will fall back on the following topic: "Biographical work from a philosophical perspective: What purpose do the life stories serve that we tell ourselves and others about ourselves?"
