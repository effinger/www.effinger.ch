On April 27 we take a look back at what has been going on in the spring of the worldwide demoscene, not least of which the results of REVISION 2018! Join us for an evening of the latest demoscene productions. As every year, REVISION also means METEORIKS - the demoscene awards by and for the demoscene. We will put all the winners on our screen, as well as our most beloved losers of 2017. Don't miss out!

## / // / ONE EFFECT COMPO // /// / /

With the unexpected (at least for us) success of One Effect Competition at DEMONIGHTS 004 came the expectation of having another round of this competition. We are amazed that we got you people creative and productive and we feel compelled to try it again. However, running a great compo requires great preparation. We are working on an improved voting mechanism, and you are welcome to contribute ideas or code to it. We will come up with some fabulous awards. And most of all, we want to encourage as many quality entries as possible.

Therefore in the early hours DEMONIGHTS 005, we will run a [scene content production workshop](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/27-4-realtime-content-production-workshop/383). Please join if you would like to:

1. Get your hands dirty while soaking in the scene spirit.
2. Learn how to run and make demos on various equipment or platforms, from retro to VR, Arduino to Wii.
3. Make some pixel art, tracker music, 3D visuals, stop-motion animation, etc.
4. Dig out some code, glue together some procedural music or graphics tutorials together.
5. See old friends, make new friends, find your group, be fabulous, get your fame!

The date for the next Compo will be announced at DEMONIGHTS 005. If you missed it, check out the results of the very first One Effect Competition: https://demozoo.org/parties/3555/#competition_14099
