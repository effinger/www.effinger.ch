## / // / ONE EFFECT COMPO // /// / /

If you have been to our [scene content production workshop](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/27-4-realtime-content-production-workshop/383), or know a little bit of programming, you know how to make things dance on the screen. Please join if you would like to:

1. Get your hands dirty while soaking in the scene spirit.
2. Learn how to run and make demos on various equipment or platforms, from retro to VR, Arduino to Wii.
3. Make some pixel art, tracker music, 3D visuals, stop-motion animation, etc.
4. Dig out some code, glue together some procedural music or graphics tutorials together.
5. See old friends, make new friends, find your group, be fabulous, get your fame!
