## Meet. Make. Game

Next thursday evening (thursday 30th of november) we are organising an event to launch a meetup group which we have been talking about. I present you Meet! Make! Game!

The idea behind the group is to gather different tallent from any area, game enthousiast and other curious in Bern area to disucss the making of games! And by game I do not mean just video games but ANY games. Board games, serious game, gamification, video games... The idea is to discuss what makes a game interesting, fun or otherwise. How are the meccanics working together to produce emotion or tramsit a message. The discussion is not meant to be technical and no particular skills are required, just a curiosity about games.

The other idea of the group is to help people from very different background to meet and network together. We hope to foster discussion between artist, programmer, sound designers, dreamers... and perhaps some fascinating projects will come out of it.

This first event will be held from 6pm to 9pm in the Effinger UG. At first we will present each others and the idea behind the group. Then a presentation will be made about the in and out of game jams as it is I beleive the most accessible way to game making. And finally we'll have some time to discuss whatever we please.

You are more than welcome to join us that night. You can find more information by joining the group here:
