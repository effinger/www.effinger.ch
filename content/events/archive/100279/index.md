<div class="lead">
You don't need a 3D-TV or VR-Glasses to delve into the third dimension. The demoscene experiments with 3D since the invention of simple anaglyph (red, cyan) glasses. In fact because of it's simplicity anaglyph 3D is still used even in more modern productions. If you don’t have any 3D glasses you can still come on the ride. We will have glasses available at the party place. Aaaand: get your clappers and productions ready! Our one-effect competition will take place again.

If you have been to our [scene content production workshop](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/27-4-realtime-content-production-workshop/383), or know a little bit of programming, you know how to make things dance on the screen. Please join if you would like to:

1. Get your hands dirty while soaking in the scene spirit.
2. Learn how to run and make demos on various equipment or platforms, from retro to VR, Arduino to Wii.
3. Make some pixel art, tracker music, 3D visuals, stop-motion animation, etc.
4. Dig out some code, glue together some procedural music or graphics tutorials together.
5. See old friends, make new friends, find your group, be fabulous, get your fame!
