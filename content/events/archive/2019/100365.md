<div class="lead">
It's been the year 1983 when Commodore asked in a freshly launched TV commercial: "Are you keeping up with the Commodore?" If anyone has kept up with the Commodore ever since, it's probably the demoscene. Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, the good name was sold to obscure companies. And the demoscene is still here. Some people say, more than ever! And we, the people, are thrilled to announce <b>Demonights 010</b>.

Please visit our recently launched website [DEMONIGHTS.CH](https://demonights.ch/en/blog/demonights-010) for details and background.
